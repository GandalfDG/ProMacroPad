# ProMacroPad
## Why can't you buy a programmer's calculator anymore?

I work in embedded software development, and fairly often I'll find that I need to convert some decimal to hexadecimal or binary. 
Sure I can open up Microsoft's Calculator, click on the hamburger menu, select programmer, and do my calculations there but I'd really
prefer to just have something on my desk always ready to go. I did some shopping around online to see if there was a cheap calculator
I could buy that could handle these basic conversion tasks, but everything I found was from the 1970's and probably contained a handfull of
leaky AA batteries.

That's where the ProMacroPad comes in.
